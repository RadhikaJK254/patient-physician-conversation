# Patient-Physician Conversation Dataset for NLP Models
This dataset is designed for training Natural Language Processing (NLP) models in healthcare applications. 
It simulates real-life conversations between patients and physicians, providing valuable insights for medical chatbots, diagnostic tools, and healthcare systems.

# Dataset Overview
The dataset includes structured dialogues featuring various medical scenarios such as symptom descriptions, diagnosis, and treatment recommendations. Each conversation is labeled with intents and medical entities to support effective model training.

# Key Features
1) Realistic patient-physician dialogues
2) Covers common illnesses, chronic conditions, and emergency scenarios
3) Labeled with intents like Symptom Inquiry, Diagnosis, and Treatment Advice
4) JSON format for easy integration into NLP models
5) Anonymized data to maintain privacy

# Usage
This dataset can be used for various NLP tasks such as:
1)Intent Classification
2) Named Entity Recognition (NER)
3) Dialogue Generation Models
4) Medical Chatbot Development


# Data Preprocessing
For optimal results, consider these preprocessing steps:
1) Remove stopwords and noise
2) Normalize medical terms (e.g., BP â†’ Blood Pressure)
3) Tokenization and lemmatization for better model performance
